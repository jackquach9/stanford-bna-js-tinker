In this assignment, I sought to learn how to create a pop-up overlay box that activated only when I clicked a certain area in an image. This will help me to implement a feature of our site, which features the Olympian plaques at Stanford and would bring up a pop-up informational box when the reader clicks on a certain plaque. I would accomplish this using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I mostly learned these skills through tutorials on W3 Schools, combining their lessons on image maps (https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images_imagemap.asp) and Javascript events (https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_events.asp). I also just played around with the different stylings to gain a sense of how everything would fit. I asked ChatGPT for small advice on styling the overlay box, but my core JS learnings were through the W3 Schools tutorials. 

With my new knowledge of image maps and JavaScript events, I feel that I have solid understanding of these concepts. While I may still have to look up documentation at times, it will be for specific syntax issues rather than a lack of conceptual logic necessary to implement this feature. I feel that I am prepared to implement this feature (or at least a mockup of it) on our website. My next steps to master my understanding would be to integrate JS with data to dynamically create pop-ups based on a variety of athletes and image pixel locations.
